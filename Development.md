Overview
Smart BI is a powerful tool that leverages natural language processing to facilitate seamless interaction with your SQL database. The project is built with a React frontend and a Flask backend, making it a robust and efficient solution for generating SQL queries from user input. In the backend, Smart BI utilizes the AWS Bedrock Claude model, ensuring accurate and efficient SQL generation.

Features
1. Natural Language to SQL Conversion
Smart BI allows users to input questions or requests in plain language, transforming them into equivalent SQL queries. This provides a user-friendly interface, enabling even non-technical users to interact with the database effortlessly.

2. AWS Bedrock Claude Model
The backend of Smart BI is powered by the AWS Bedrock Claude model, a cutting-edge technology designed for accurate and context-aware SQL generation. This ensures that the generated queries are not only syntactically correct but also semantically aligned with the user's intent.
